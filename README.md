# Invisalign scan exporter

A browser extension that allows you to export the scans made for the Invisalign teeth aligners to .obj files.

I am not affiliated in any way with Invisalign. I just created this because I wanted to 3D print my jaw as it was before using aligners.

The code is very sloppy but I'm sharing it in case someone finds it useful. Keep in mind I only had one input to test (my own jaw scan) so it may not work in other cases.

## How To Use

Load the unpacked extension in your browser. With the extension loaded, if you visit the Invisalign web viewer (with an URL `share.invisalign.com/treatment-viewer/*`) you can click in the extension to export the 3D model to a .obj file.
